# Summary

There are so many cable chains here on Thingiverse but most are missing endparts to attach them. Further they are mostly closed so the cables need to be fed through. This is ok for newly created printers but for upgrading an existing one it's a pain. 
Primary goal was to make it printable without the need of support.
This one is especially for the HyperCube but not exclusively. The endparts fit on 2020 extrusions on the frame and the heatbed. Cables can easily be mounted and fixed with the clip-on bar.

Hope you like it.
